,What distinguishes inductive arguments from deductive arguments?,"Inductive arguments go beyond what is contained in the premises, while deductive arguments rely solely on the premises for their conclusion.","CS::theory-of-science, CS::WITT::Chapter4"
,What is the problem of induction and who was the philosopher who articulated it?,"The problem of induction refers to the question of how induction itself is to be justified.

,What are ad hoc modifications?,Ad hoc modifications are modifications made to a theory that have no new testable consequences and are designed to protect the theory from falsificationism.,"CS::theory-of-science, CS::WITT::Chapter5"
,Why are ad hoc modifications generally not acceptable to falsificationists?,"Because they believe that as a science progresses, its theories should become more falsifiable and informative. Ad hoc modifications are seen as ways to prevent a theory from being falsified, rather than making it more informative.","CS::theory-of-science, CS::WITT::Chapter6"
,What is an ad hoc hypothesis?,A hypothesis created solely to defend a theory or explanation from being falsified without providing any new evidence or tests.,"CS::theory-of-science, CS::WITT::Chapter6"

,What is the main difference between falsificationism and inductivism?,"Falsificationism recognizes that facts and theories are fallible, while inductivism requires science to hav ean unproblematic factual foundation.","CS::theory-of-science, CS::WITT::Chapter6"
,Why is it impossible to conclusively falsify a theory through observation?,"Even if a theory is based on strong observation, the falsificationist’s position rejects the idea that it is immune to future disproof, and newer evidence or knowledge may alter its standing.","CS::theory-of-science, CS::WITT::Chapter7"
,What is the Duhem/Quine thesis?,The Duhem/Quine thesis refers to the idea that a theory cannot be conclusively falsified because an incorrect prediction may be caused by factors other than the theory under test.,"CS::theory-of-science, CS::WITT::Chapter7"
